										<p>Michael is the team lead. His responsibility is to support each subteam by providing resources and guidance towards developing and designing a solar-powered boat. Michaelâ€™s project experience is creating and building power systems that use solar energy as its power source. Michael managed a solar boat project at his community college that involved the process of molding the vessel and laying out the fiberglass for the boat. The boat was entered into the solar regatta competition 2016 and won two trophies; Best Design and Most Aesthetic. He managed another construction project involving a net-zero energy house construction project. The project purpose is eliminating the use of a gas power generator for supplying the power for the construction tools.
